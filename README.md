# POWER-IN-YOUR-HANDS
Our aim was to create a website that would help the farmers of india living in the rural areas.
We created a common platform for them to buy and sell raw or manufactured products.
People could also donate for the upliftment of their living standards.
They could create and maintain their profiles and socialize with their fellow people.
We provided the amenities like education and medication in nearby hospitals via contacting NGO's.
They could advertise their products with the rates and details on it.
